    <h2>Jamaican Curry Chicken Recipe</h2>

    <p>Jamaican curry chicken was a regular staple growing up, and now it is for my own family.</p>

    <p>Now you may be saying to yourself...wait, a curry is a curry. Not so fast. There is a slight difference between Jamaican curry and Indian curry. Jamaican curry has more tumeric, allspice (pimento), scotch bonnet peppers, and nutmeg. It is not only more yellow in colour, it also has a distinct difference in flavor.</p>
